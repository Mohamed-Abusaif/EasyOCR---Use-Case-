# Project Title

This is a Simple OCR Text Detection System (and Filtering for the photos) Using Python

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for text detection and filtering purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3: Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official Python website.
- Virtual Environment: It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
- You can create a virtual environment using venv or virtualenv.
- OpenCV: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. You can install it using
  ```python
  pip: pip install opencv-python.
  ```
- EasyOCR: EasyOCR is an easy-to-use optical character recognition (OCR) tool. You can install it using pip:
  ```python
  pip install easyocr.
  ```
- NumPy: NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. You can install it using pip:
  ```python
  pip install numpy.
  ```

### Installing

- Clone the repository to your local machine using git (ssh - http- zip file) as you want.
- Navigate to the project directory
- Create and activate a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- Install the required dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Run the Python scripts to perform text detection and filtering.
